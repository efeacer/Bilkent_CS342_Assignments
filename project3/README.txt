- In order to compile the ralloc library, the app.c and the experiment.c files type:
    -> make
  in this directory.

- If you want to recompile the library and the other .c files type:
    -> make clean
    -> make
  again in this directory.

- To run the app, type:
    -> ./app
  Note that the app generates processes with random demands so there is no stable output. 

- To run the program used for the experiment, type:
    -> ./experiment

- The deadlock handling method must be changed inside the code for the app.c and experiment.c files.
