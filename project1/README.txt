The directory includes report.pdf, bilshell.c, Makefile, infile.txt, producer.c and consumer.c.

producer.c and consumer.c programs are added in case the grader wants to compile them.

bilshell can be executed as follows:
	- Navigate to this directory
	- > make
	- > ./bilshell <your value of N>
	
to run bilshell in the batch mode, add the filename as the third argument, the infile.txt I have provided
includes the composed command: ./producer 1000000 | ./consumer 1000000
